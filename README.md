### What's up! 🤟

"Network science researcher" or "quantative analyst" would be cool things to put here, but I've still got a long way to go as a freshman at **Northeastern University**. Areas I have the most experience in are: **web development, AI and machine learning**, and reading documentation (?).  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on leveraging Auto-GPT and to perform research tasks. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OCaml - or at least stepping back from Python into functional programming. 
- I've used: ```.java```, ```.py```, ```.js```, and ```.c``` (also lots of React ⚛️)

_Note: I have many repos but few readme-s_
