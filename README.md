### What's up! ğŸ¤Ÿ

I'm a first-year at Northeastern University studying computer science and mathematics. With a breadth of experience in AI/ML, I'm eager to explore any subset of roles in those fields. 

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently learning machine learning methods on graphs in preparation for a RA position. 
- ğŸŒ± I'm looking to learn C++ by implementing some trading models and financial forecasts. 
- ğŸ’¡ I often use: ```.py``` and ```.js```
