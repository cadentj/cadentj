I'm a first-year at Northeastern University studying computer science and mathematics. With a breadth of experience in AI/ML, I'm eager to explore any subset of roles in those fields. 

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently researching graph machine learning methods in mobility resilience. 
- ğŸŒ± I'm diving into C++ with algo-trading. 
- ğŸ’¡ I often use: ```.py``` and ```.js```
