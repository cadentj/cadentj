### What's up! 🤟

"Network science researcher" or "quantative analyst" would be cool things to put here, but I've got a long way to go as a freshman at Northeastern University. Areas I have the most experience in are: web development, AI and machine learning, and reading documentation (?).  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on leveraging Auto-GPT and to perform rapid and thorough research tasks. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OCaml - or at least stepping back from Python and learning functional programming.
